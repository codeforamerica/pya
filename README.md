## Deployment to AWS Staging

This project uses a GitHub Actions workflow to automatically deploy to the AWS staging environment after tests pass on the `main` branch.

### Workflow Breakdown

#### 1. Test Job

- Runs the full Rails test suite:
  ```bash
  bin/rails db:test:prepare test test:system
  ```
- Sends test status notifications to Slack, tagging the appropriate team members

#### 2. Deploy Job

- Executes only if the test job completes successfully
- Builds a Docker image and pushes it to Amazon ECR
- Updates an AWS Systems Manager (SSM) parameter with the image tag to track the deployed version
- Triggers a downstream GitHub Action in the [`tax-benefits-backend`](https://github.com/codeforamerica/tax-benefits-backend) repository using a `repository_dispatch` event, passing:

  ```json
  {
    "environment": "pya-nonprod",
    "config": "staging.pya.fileyourstatetaxes.org"
  }
  ```

### Environment Variables & Secrets

The workflow relies on the following secrets:

- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY` / `AWS_SECRET_KEY`: Credentials for accessing AWS services (ECR, SSM)
- `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL`: Sends Slack notifications for test results
- `STAGING_DEPLOY_PAT`: GitHub Personal Access Token used to trigger the downstream deployment workflow
